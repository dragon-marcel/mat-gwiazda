# AI Rules for MatGwiazda

MatGwiazda is an interactive web app designed for learning math for students in grades 1-8.
The app uses an AI algorithm to generate math problems tailored to the student's level and
incorporates gamification elements through a points and level system to increase user engagement.

## Tech Stack

- Astro 5
- TypeScript 5
- React 19
- Tailwind 4
- Shadcn/ui
- Java 17 with Spring Boot 3
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for backend services

## Project Structure

When introducing changes to the project, always follow the directory structure below:
- `./backend` - Java Spring Boot backend'
- `./db` - Supabase clients and types
- `./frontend/src/layouts` - Astro layouts
- `./frontend/src/pages` - Astro pages
- `./frontend/src/pages/api` - API endpoints
- `./frontend/src/components` - Client-side components written in Astro (static) and React (dynamic)
- `./frontend/src/components/ui` - Client-side components from Shadcn/ui
- `./frontend/src/assets` - static internal assets

When modifying the directory structure, always update this section.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

## BACKEND

### Guidelines for JAVA

#### SPRING_BOOT

- Use Spring Boot for simplified configuration and rapid development with sensible defaults
- Prefer constructor-based dependency injection over `@Autowired`
- Avoid hardcoding values that may change externally, use configuration parameters instead
- For complex logic, use Spring profiles and configuration parameters to control which beans are injected instead of hardcoded conditionals
- If a well-known library simplifies the solution, suggest using it instead of generating a custom implementation
- Use DTOs as immutable `record` types
- Use Bean Validation annotations (e.g., `@Size`, `@Email`, etc.) instead of manual validation logic
- Use `@Valid` on request parameters annotated with `@RequestBody`
- Use custom exceptions for business-related scenarios
- Centralize exception handling with `@ControllerAdvice` and return a consistent error DTO: `{{error_dto}}`
- REST controllers should handle only routing and I/O mapping, not business logic
- Use SLF4J for logging instead of `System.out.println`
- Prefer using lambdas and streams over imperative loops and conditionals where appropriate
- Use `Optional` to avoid `NullPointerException`

## Frontend

### General Guidelines

- Use Astro components (.astro) for static content and layout
- Implement framework components in React only when interactivity is needed

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus-visible:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements

### Guidelines for Accessibility

#### ARIA Best Practices

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify regions of the page (main, navigation, search, etc.)
- Apply appropriate ARIA roles to custom interface elements that lack semantic HTML equivalents
- Set aria-expanded and aria-controls for expandable content like accordions and dropdowns
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness settings for dynamic content updates
- Implement aria-hidden to hide decorative or duplicative content from screen readers
- Apply aria-label or aria-labelledby for elements without visible text labels
- Use aria-describedby to associate descriptive text with form inputs or complex elements
- Implement aria-current for indicating the current item in a set, navigation, or process
- Avoid redundant ARIA that duplicates the semantics of native HTML elements

### Guidelines for Astro

- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions (use ClientRouter)
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Use POST, GET  - uppercase format for endpoint handlers
- Use `export const prerender = false` for API routes
- Use zod for input validation in API routes
- Extract logic into services in `src/lib/services`
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables

### Guidelines for React

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Never use "use client" and other Next.js directives as we use React with Astro
- Extract logic into custom hooks in `src/components/hooks`
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use supabase from context.locals in Astro routes instead of importing supabaseClient directly
